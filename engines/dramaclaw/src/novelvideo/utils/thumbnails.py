"""On-demand downscaled image variants for media served over ``/static``.

The canvas UI renders full-resolution originals into tiny boxes — a node's
generation-history strip paints 5504x3072 PNGs into 56x56 thumbnails. The
bytes are only half the problem: even over localhost, where transfer is
free, nine such images cost ~2.1s of main-thread decode + raster in the
browser and drop seven frames. Serving a pre-shrunk variant removes that
work entirely (measured: 105.4MB -> 0.23MB, 2156ms of long tasks -> 0).

The cache is addressed purely by source path::

    <project_dir>/_thumbs/<variant>/<path relative to project_dir>.webp

so nothing about it leaks into a data schema. History records and canvas
JSON keep storing the original URL; callers opt in per render by asking for
a variant, and old data benefits without any backfill.
Freshness is exact rather than heuristic: a generated variant is stamped
with its source's mtime, so ``thumb.mtime == source.mtime`` means current
and a regenerated source invalidates automatically without leaving stale
files behind.

Building and serving are deliberately separate. ``fresh_thumbnail`` is what a
request calls and it never builds; ``ensure_thumbnail`` builds and only ever
runs in the background. A variant a request wants but does not have is queued
and the original goes out instead, so a cold project costs exactly what it did
before variants existed and warms itself up as it is used.

Every failure path returns ``None`` so the caller falls back to the
original. A slow node beats a broken one.
